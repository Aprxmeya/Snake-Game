*Welcome to this meticulously crafted project. Every single line of this README has been carefully written to make it seem like I totally know what I’m doing. Of course, you’ll find nothing but pure professionalism here, because that’s what developers do, right? It’s not like I wrote this just to check a box or anything. Nope, not at all. Feel free to scroll down, pretend to read the instructions, and then immediately jump to the code like we all do anyway. Cheers to fake formalities!*
